**sunday-driver** works through a large file *at a responsible* pace - it pauses to let you consider the data, at given points, and waits to resume working once that's all done.

this allows processing a large file, by sizable chunks, without any race-conditions or memory leaking.

(heavily) inspired by [line-by-line](https://github.com/Osterjour/line-by-line), by [Markus Ostertag](https://github.com/Osterjour)üôè

<div align="center">
  <code>npm i sunday-driver</code>
</div>

```js
const sundayDriver = require('sunday-driver')

let options= {
	file: './my/large/file.tsv',
	splitter: '\n',
	start: '80%', //as percentages, or in bytes
	end: '100%',
	//do your thing, for each segment
	each: (chunk, resume) => {
		console.log(chunk)//do your thing..
		resume()
	}
	//log progress-based events
	atPercent: {
		50: (status) => {
			console.log('50%!')
		},
		75: () => {
			console.log('75%!')
		},
	},
	//log time-based events
	atInterval: {
		'1min': (status) => {
		console.log('1 minute')
		},
		'2mins': () => {
		console.log('2 minutes')
		},
	}
}

sundayDriver(options).then((status)=>{
	console.log('done!')
})
```

any events/intervals will provide you with all the details of the current reader's status:
```js
/*{
  chunksDone:: 10,     // how many times we've called the 'each' function
	bytesDone:: 20480,   // how many bytes we've processed so far
	filesize:: 61440,    // size of the whole file
	position: 34.42,     // where, in percentage, we are in the file. (if we didn't start at the top!)
	progress: 68.84      // how far, in percentage, we are to being complete
}*/
```

it was built to support unleashing multiple workers on the same file, and letting them run safely and responsibly, without blowing any fuses.

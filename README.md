**sunday-driver** never gets ahead of itself - it works through a large file *at a responsible pace*.

It pauses to let you consider the data, at given points, and waits to resume working once that's done.

this allows processing a large file, by sizable chunks, without any race-conditions or memory leaking.

(heavily) inspired by [line-by-line](https://github.com/Osterjour/line-by-line), by [Markus Ostertag](https://github.com/Osterjour)🙏

it was built to support using multiple workers on the same file, and letting them run independently and responsibly.

<div align="center">
  <code>npm i sunday-driver</code>
</div>

```js
const SundayDriver = require('sunday-driver')

let options= {
  file: './my/large/file.tsv',
  splitter: '\n',
  start: '80%', //as percentages, or in bytes
  end: '100%',
}

let runner = new SundayDriver(options)

//gets a the same thing as you would from a .split()
runner.on('each', (chunk, resume) => {
  console.log(chunk)//do your thing..
  resume()
})
runner.on('end', () => {
  console.log('done!')
})
runner.on('error', console.error)
```

at any time, when you want a report, you can call `.status()`:
```js
runner.status()
/*{
  chunksDone:: 10,      //how many times we've called .on('each',fn)
	bytesDone:: 20480,    //how many bytes we've processed so far
	position: 34.42, //where, in percentage, we are in the file. (if we didn't start at the top!)
	progress: 68.84  //how far, in percentage, we are to being complete
}*/
```
